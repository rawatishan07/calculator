# Project Overview

The primary purpose of this mini-project was to apply foundational computer science concepts while gaining practical exposure to industry-standard development and collaboration tools.

### 1. Application Goal

The application is a simple command-line interface (CLI) calculator designed to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Its simplicity allows for a focus on the development process and tool utilization rather than complex logic.

### 2. Tools Utilized

The assignment mandated the use of the following tools:

| Tool | Purpose in Project | Assignment Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Python 3** | Core language used to write the application logic. | Project Selection. |
| **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** | Used for writing, testing, and debugging the code. | Development Environment]. |
| **Git** | Used for local version control (`git init`, `git add`, `git commit`). | Version Control]. |
| **GitHub** | Used for remote repository hosting and collaborative potential (`git push`). | Collaboration Tool]. |

### 3. Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows to ensure professionalism and compliance with submission standards:

* **Root Directory:** Contains the source code (`calculator.py`), the primary `README.md`, and the essential `.gitignore` file.
* **`docs/` Folder:** Contains internal project documentation (`Overview.md`, `DevelopmentProcess.md`, `FutureImprovements.md`).
